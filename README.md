# Kalman-Filters in Pytorch

An API for building kalman-filters whose parameters (e.g., process-noise, measurement noise, covariance-structure) can be optimized using pytorch. Additionally provides tools for integrating torch.nn.Modules into these kalman-filters.

Still in active development, more documentation coming soon.
